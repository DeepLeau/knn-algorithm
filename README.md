# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

## Overview

Welcome to the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier project! This implementation allows for efficient classification of data with 7 parameters. Each data point has an associated class to predict, ranging from 0 to 3. The algorithm excels in determining the class of a data point with high precision by finding the optimal number of k neighbors through cross-validation.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Code:**
   - Execute the code to start the KNN Classifier.
   - The implementation will load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing.

2. **Set Parameters:**
   - Configure the algorithm parameters, such as the number of neighbors (k), to suit your specific dataset and requirements.

3. **Train the Model:**
   - Train the KNN model using the provided dataset.
